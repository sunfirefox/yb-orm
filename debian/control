Description: YB.ORM is an Object-Relational Mapper library for C++
 YB.ORM tool is developed to simplify for C++ developers creation of
 applications that work with relational databases. An Object-Relational
 Mapper (ORM) works by mapping database tables to classes and table records
 to objects in some programming language. The goals of YB.ORM project are:
 provide a convenient API for C++ developers,
 retain high performance of C++,
 keep the source code easily portable across different platforms,
 support most major relational Data Base Management Systems (DBMS).
